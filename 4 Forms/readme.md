## Adding Form <a name="section1"></a>
**Interactive forms** are created by adding text elements and input fields to a canvas. Once a form has been created, it can then be added as a start trigger for the business process or for an user approval or to send notifications in the business process.

Currently there are two types of Forms:
  - **Simple Form** : used for sending notification or as a start trigger of the business process. It has one pre-configured Submit button.
  - **Approval Form** : approvals are managed by creating and adding an **Approval Form** to a business process. It has pre-configured  Approve and Reject buttons.

When creating forms, you can use different form elements for Layout and  Fields. These **Form elements** can then be added to the form canvas by dragging and dropping them.

Each **Form input field** can be added to both a standard form and an approval form. These fields allow you to design and manage the information displayed to the process participant. Like whether the field will be a dropdown, or a checkbox etc. or whether the field is mandatory or not, or if has a text limit, or whether its read-only etc.

In this section, you will create 3 forms:
  - **Auto-approval Form**: this will be a simple form to inform the requestor that the sales order is approved automatically.
  - **Supplier Approval Form**: this will be an approval form which will be send to the approvers determined by the decision table for their approval.
  - **Notification Form**: this will be a simple form to inform the requestor whether their sales order is approved or rejected by the supplier.
