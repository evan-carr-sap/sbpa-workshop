## Description <a name="section1"></a>

**SAP Build Process Automation** have dedicated **Monitoring** page that collects events coming from the deployed workflows and automation jobs and presents them to the user. These events represent the state of the agents, the status of the jobs that have been run, and the business activity of monitoring events.

The **Application Development** offers these are different monitoring apps:
   - **Process and Workflow Instances**: you can see a list of all workflow instances and act on those instances.
   - **Automation Jobs**: you can view all your automation errors, warnings, variables, and other information on the console.
   - **Acquired Events**: you can view the events that have been acquired by the process visibility.
   - **Visibility Scenarios**: you can manage your visibility scenarios by scheduling the job for processing the data and clearing the processed data. You can also view the processing log information and the details of a scenario definition in this view.

## Release Business Process Project <a name="section4"></a>

Release individual projects once they are finished.

There are two possible  situations:
   - When you're releasing a new business process project, enter a brief summary of the changes in the **Release Notes** (optional) then Choose **Release**
   - When you're releasing a modified version of a business process project that is already released, in the Release **Version Contains dialogue**, select one of the following:
        - Select **Bug Fix** to indicate bug fixes. It updates the third digit of the version number.
        - Select **Minor Changes** to indicate small modifications. It updates the second digit of the version number.
        - Select **Major Changes** to indicate important modifications potentially leading to incompatibility between versions. It updates the first digit of the version number.


1. In the Process Builder, click on **Release**

    ![Release](images/Deployment/Release/01_Process_final.png)

2.a For the first version, add a **Version Comment** if needed and click on **Release**

   ![Release first](images/Deployment/Release/02_Release_first_version.png)

2.b For the additional version, choose the type of version, add a **Version Annotation** if needed and click on **Release**

   ![Release new](images/Deployment/Release/02_Release_second_version.png)

3. The project Released successfully is ready to be deployed
    > If needed, you can refer to the [Documentation](https://help.sap.com/viewer/DRAFT/d668fd319a104511b515d574782b497f/Dev/en-US/5ec3714e12ce487da35c009505eaf3a5.html)

## Deploy Released Project<a name="section5"></a>

You can deploy business process projects from each released version of the project in the Process Builder or through Lobby.

1. From the released version of the business process project in the Process Builder, click on **Deploy**

![Start Deploy](images/Deployment/Deploy/01_Released_first_version.png)

2. Fill the **Variables** and click on **Confirm**

   > Variables allow you to reuse certain information for a given business process project deployement.

   > You use variables to pass parameters to automations. You can create variables in the Process Builder for which you can later set values when deploying the  business process project. For example, in the current use case, we create a "Filepath" variable with a string value that contains the local filepath of the Sales Orders Details Excel file used in the Automation.

   ![Deploy confirm first](images/Deployment/Deploy/02_Deploy_first_version.png)

3. Click on **Deploy**

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (1. Access the launchpad via this URL)
